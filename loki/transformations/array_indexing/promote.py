    Promote a list of variables by inserting new array dimensions of given size
    and updating all uses of these variables with a given index expression.

    When providing only :data:`size` or :data:`index`, promotion is restricted
    to updating only variable declarations or their use, respectively, and the
    other is left unchanged.

    Parameters
    ----------
    routine : :any:`Subroutine`
        The subroutine in which the variables should be promoted.
    variable_names : list of str
        The names of variables to be promoted. Matching of variables against
        names is case-insensitive.
    pos : int
        The position of the new array dimension using Python indexing
        convention (i.e., count from 0 and use negative values to count from
        the end).
    index : :py:class:`pymbolic.primitives.Expression`, optional
        The indexing expression (or a tuple for multi-dimension promotion)
        to use for the promotion dimension(s), e.g., loop variables. Usage of
        variables is only updated if `index` is provided. When the index
        expression is not live at the variable use, ``:`` is used instead.
    size : :py:class:`pymbolic.Expression`, optional
        The size of the dimension (or tuple for multi-dimension promotion) to
        insert at `pos`. When this is provided, the declaration of variables
